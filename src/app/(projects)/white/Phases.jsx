        Hilo is the first night of the Hawaiian Moon
        calendar when the new moon is slender and twisted. The first
        night of the kapu period, or sacred time, for the god Kü, it
        is a good night for deep sea and torch fishing.
        Women also fished by hand in the pools left by the sea.
        On river banks, people caught 'o'opu (gobey fish) and öpae
        (shrimp) in hand held nets.

        <p>Hoaka, which means "faint light" or "casting a shadow,"
          is the second sacred or kapu night for the god Kū. The hoaka, or arch
          of the door of a house, was named for this crescent shaped phase of the moon.
          On the evening when Hoaka rises, the tide is low until morning. Some said ghosts
          would cast shadows and frighten fish away, but it was also considered by some to
          be a good time for night fishing. A favorable day for planting, in the old days it

          was rigorous.  People spent their days in worship, but when Christianity began to take hold, converts
          broke the kapu, and could be readily seen, planting and fishing. According to Kepelino, it is a day of
          very low tide, "joyous for men who fish with lines and for girls who dive for sea urchins."

          This is a kapu night dedicated to the worship of Lono and the expression of gratitude for the bounty
          of the month. Prayers for rain are also offered. 'Uala (sweet potato), hue (gourd), and other round,
          full bodied crops are planted, as they are kino lau or body forms of Lono. The tide is low and the seas
          calm. The "sea begins to wash back the sand that the rough sea has scooped up."

          The Mauli moon rises just before sunrise.  The 29th night means the "last breath" and it is the last
          night of the month that the moon is visible.
          Uli also implies rich, dark green vegetation and thus this moon is a very good
          day for planting. The tide is low and there is
          "a sea that gathers up and returns the sand to its place." Marriages are often performed on this day.

          Muku, the final lunar night, is often a totally darkened moon. Its name means
          "finished" or "cut off," and also refers to the
          "dying" of the moon. It is a day for planting crops. Trees and sugar cane will prosper and
          bananas will bear bunches one muku long (from the tip of the fingers of one hand to the opposite
          elbow). A day of low tide, it is good for diving for sea urchins, gathering limu, and line fishing by children.
